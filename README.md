# Casa-De-Vacaciones (holiday-home)



## Abstract

HomeToGo is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales. HomeToGo offers people an easy, relatively stress-free way to earn some income from their property. HomeToGo is providing a way for people to monetize their property while also providing a way for people who are traveling to have a different experience than a hotel. Additionally, hotels are also heavily taxed by the cities, and while cities are rushing to tax HomeToGo, it has been a way to avoid a charge that should mostly be considered unconstitutional. Our government should not compete in business with its citizens, yet it does so in many ways and often wins such battles by making unjust laws and taxes.
